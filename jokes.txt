Who doesn't need a few jokes?

"How do astronauts have a space party? They plan-it"

"How do astronauts put a baby to sleep? They rock-it"

Very high quality, I know.

I didn't like the joke, but I'll tell you a good one in spanish.

"Que le dijo un perro a otro perro?"

"Nada, porque los perros no hablan"
